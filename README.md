# Blackjack

## Intro

Getting back into full-stack development by making my first game post-bootcamp.

Used a [Deck of Cards api](http://deckofcardsapi.com), which included image links for the cards and string values for the suit and the value of the cards.

### Current Issues

- Game does not initialize the scores accurately nor consistently

### TODO

Making this with the latest version of Next.js after working with previous versions was a challenge with the new file architecture.
These todos are in no particular order:

- Add jest and create unit tests
- Update the score calculation
- Add axe accessibility check
- Update styling in case of light mode
- Update the game to allow the dealer/house to also add cards to their hand.
- Start branching properly with PRs instead of making quick commits

Initial version after maybe 4 hours of making mistakes with api calls

Current version as of Mar 7, 7:15 PM

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
